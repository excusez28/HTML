    <strong>Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often brightly
    coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the
    superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others). The oldest butterfly fossils
    have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though molecular evidence suggests that they likely
    originated in the Cretaceous.</strong>
